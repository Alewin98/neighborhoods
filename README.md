# Collaborating with git and GitHub

## Setup

 - **Create a GitHub account** if you don’t already have one here: https://github.com/
 - **Install git** (either the graphical tool or the command line tool)
   - Graphical tool: https://desktop.github.com/
   - Command line tool: https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/#setting-up-git
 - **Install python** (windows only - Mac comes preinstalled) We use python to
serve up our site locally, so you can test your changes.
   - Download Python 3.5 (or any version is fine) here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
   - Detailed installation instructions: http://www.howtogeek.com/197947/how-to-install-python-on-windows
- **Install a text editor.** We use a text editor to write code. There are a
million to choose from. If you’re not sure which one to use, why not
give Atom a try: https://atom.io/

If you get hung up on any of the setup steps *DON’T PANIC!* We can help
you!
